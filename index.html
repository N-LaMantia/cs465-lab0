    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my first CS465 website.</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Here is a picture of my cat.</h3>
    <p>Her name is Snicker! She is a very cute cat with a funky personality.
        She loves to cuddle and play with toys, occasionally nipping you when she gets too excited.
        Lastly, her belly is a trap.
